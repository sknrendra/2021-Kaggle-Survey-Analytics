# 2021-Kaggle-Survey-Analytics
This is a result of the author's analysis of Kaggle 2021 machine learning and data science survey results. This survey is focused on analyzing two biggest cloud computing providers, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

Currently, AWS dominate the cloud computing industry, but Google is trying to catch up with their product, Google Cloud Platform. A simple examination in the data shows that people are just as interested in Google Cloud Platform than Amazon Web Services, even though the latter currently is the market leader. The author further analyzed the data to find out which type of survey respondents more interested towards Google Cloud Platform rather than Amazon Web Services. We found that research scientists, doctoral degree holders and those who never have experience writing code are the ones who are most interested in Google Cloud Platform. On the other hand, software engineers, project managers, bachelor's degree holders and those who have between 1-5 experience in writing code are the ones who are most interested in learning Amazon Web Services.
